**Online Reservation System**

Java Swing: I created a visually stunning and responsive user interface by utilizing Java Swing's capabilities. Because to Swing's adaptability and agility, I was able to design a reservation process that users could easily navigate.

Database Integration: I included a strong database system to guarantee data accessibility and integrity. Users were able to easily manage their accounts, examine their booking history, and make appointments thanks to this.

User Authentication: Since security is crucial, I put in place a safe method for user authentication. This gave the system an additional degree of confidence while simultaneously protecting user data.
